       This program demonstrates a simple use of an array of records /abstract data types 
       Ultimately it is better to create an ADT of a 
       'database of students', that is implemented as an array of records.
       
        Notice how as the new Student () call is bound in to the createStudent method we 
        use to initalise Student records once that method is written we can forget about 
        the subtleties of having to first allocate memory for the record and then initialise
         it as they are all packaged together in CreateStudent.
         
         That is an advantage of using methods.
