    "## Why another loop\n",
    "We have already seen a way to do repetition, with the counter-controlled loop. Why do we need another kind of loop? Because there are some kinds of repetition that cannot be done with a counter-controlled loop. In particular, counter-controlled loops rely on knowing how many times the loop will execute in advance - knowing what the counter is to count to. If the loop needs to repeat an unknown number of times (in the sense that it can't be worked out when the loop starts), then we need something else.\n",
