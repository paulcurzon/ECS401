    "In particular, there is a way to do repetition that works in a completely different way: recursion. It does not use a specially defined looping construct like the while loop. Instead it does repetition just by using methods that call themselves. It does not allow us to write programs that cannot be written with a while loop, just a new way to do the same thing."

None of the calls ever return as they are too busy doing another call and the following return statement is never executed. However, eventually it crashes because each call to a method uses up a little space on the stack to set up the call and remember where the call will return to. That space is only freed when the call returns. As no return ever happens it just uses up more and more memory. The stack has a finite size, however. Eventually, all of the stack is filled with information about calls and where to return. At that point the stack runs out of memory and \"overflows\" causing the program to crash. Each line in the error message is essentially a record of a method call reporting it has crashed and passing the exception back to the previous one.

Once it has that answer to that calculation (3) which it stores in vsariable, answerssofar, it adds the current countdown value to it (also 3) to give the total 6. \n",

At that point they are restored as the visible values of variables with htose names.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, countdown being 2 still means the else case is executed, and that means another recursive call. It does the recursive call sumton_recursive(1) to get the answer to sum to 1, adds it to the 2 in countdown to get total 3 and returns that total to the earlier call as noted above.\n",

It created a new version of countdown, this one holding the value 1 that was passed as an argument this time. 1 is greater than 0 to the else case is executed. It did a recursive call to sumton_recursive(0) which returned the value 0. It was added to countdown so that the total 1 was returned as noted above.\n",

That allowed sumton_recursive(1) to calculate and return its total (1), which allowed sumton_recursive(2) to calculate and return its total (3), which allowed sumton_recursive(3) to calculate and return its total (6).\n",
