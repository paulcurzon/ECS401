    "- A program consists of commands to be followed in a specific order.\n",
    "    - These commands are grouped into procedures (which are also known as methods)\n",
    "- The command to print a message to the screen is System.out.println\n",
    "    - it is just a procedure that is already defined for you to use\n",
    "    - Place the message to be printed in quotes inside the () of the call of System.out.println\n",
    "    - After printing the message the program moves onto a next line ready to print the next thing.\n",
    "- The command to ask a question of the user (input) is scanner.nextLine();\n",
    "    - the value that the user types is stored in a variable\n",
    "    - a variable is just a named storage place\n",
    "    - Once something is stored in a variable, you can get the value back using the name of the variable\n",
    "- A program is made up of lots of procedure definitions.\n",
    "    - Procedure definitions attach a name to a procedure body (the actual instructions)\n",
    "    - They are a bit like individual recipes\n",
    "    - The name is used to call the procedure (ie follow the instructions in the body)\n",
    "    - Procedure definitions end with a return statement (it sends the program back to where it was called from)\n",
    "- Procedures only do something when they are called.\n",
    "    - A procedure is called by giving its name followed by open and close brackets ().\n",
    "    - When a procedure is called the instructions in its body are executed in the order written.\n",
    "    - A procedure is a kind of method.\n",
    "    - When you call a method, you jump to the code in the body, execute it then jump back to where you were and carry on with the next command from there.\n",
    "    - you can call other procedures you have defined inside a procedure.\n",
    "- All programs should include comments\n",
    "    - Comments are just explanations of what parts of the program do to help a human understand them\n",
    "    - They start with //\n",
    "    - Each method/procedure should include a comment saying what it does.\n",
    "    - Each program should have a comment saying what the program as a whole does.\n",
    "- Variables must be declared\n",
    "    - They must be given names that indicate what they are used for.\n",
