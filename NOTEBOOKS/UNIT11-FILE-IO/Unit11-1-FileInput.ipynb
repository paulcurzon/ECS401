    "All our programs up to this point have been able to store data in variables, so the data is either on the stack or on the heap. However, the moment the program ends, the data is lost. Neither the stack or heap are **persistent** storage. When you restart the program, none of the data is available any more. Real programs need data that has been input or generated to survive the program closing so you can carry on where you left off. you might be saving the state of a game, a wordprocessor document or a program being developed.  The file system of the computer provides persistent storage. To do this we need file input and output. Data is written into a file and then can be read in by the program at a later date, or by a different \n",
