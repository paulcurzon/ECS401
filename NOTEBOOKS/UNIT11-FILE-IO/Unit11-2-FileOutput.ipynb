    "One part of persistent storage is to be able to read data from a file. We saw how to do that in the notebook for unit 11.1 The other side is to store data back into a file. That is called writing to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file I/O methods are part of the io library so if a full program is going to do file input or output then the library must be loaded. A full program must include the command at the start:\n",

    "import java.io.*;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This library is automatically loaded in JHUB so you do not need to worry about it for these exercises.\n",

    "Virtually, all programs have some kind of Save option. It allows the user to end the program and to carry on later from where they left off, whether editing an essay or playing a game. That menu option is just leading to a method being executed that writes data currently stored in variables in the program to a file."

    "Once data has been read in from a file and is stored in variables in a program, typically in an array of records, it can easily be processed, whether printed, added to or changed. How does data get into a file in the first place though? A program that someone wrote puts it there.\n",

However, any changes to the data made by the program do not affect the file itself unless data is written back to the file.  Without file output the changes to the data are lost when the program quits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also often programs input lots of data from the keyboard. Then we normally want that data to persist so we can end the program and run the program again later to carry on. That can only be done if the data input so far can be stored into a file. Otherwise every time we ran the program we would need to input all the data again by hand."
