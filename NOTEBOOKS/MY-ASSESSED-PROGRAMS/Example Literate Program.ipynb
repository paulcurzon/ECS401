    "# Assessment: Example Literate Program\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "Each of your assessed programs should be written in two forms: as a literate program  in a notebook (as here) and as a complete program included at the end of the literate version, that you have also saved in a file and compiled and run locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "The literate program provides a way for you to explain your thinking, how you answered the question, by you describing the methods you used and how the program works. Learning to program is not just about producing some working code, its about learning how to think about programming, developing your knowledge and skills. We need to assess the development of your  knowledge, skills and understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "This document (excluding this explanation seciton) is an example of a literate program of the kind you are expected to produce for the assessed programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't expect to understand the detail in the example literate program at the start of our module, we will take you step by step, to a point where it will all make much more sense to you.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literate Program style required:\n",
    "- The literate program notebook should start with a sumary statement of the question\n",
    "- Each method should have a detailed description as text (in Markdown) before the method \n",
    "- It should describe in detail how it works, essentially giving an argument that it does work as required\n",
    "- Programs should **also** be commented as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "- The program as a whole should start with a comment that includes\n",
    "    - Author\n",
    "    - Date\n",
    "    - Version (eg changing version after each time it has been assessed if assessed multiple times)\n",
    "    - An overview of its purpose\n",
    "- Each method should be preceded by a comment explaining what its purpose is \n",
    "    - what it does (not how it does it)\n",
    "- Specific tricky detail may have specific comments explaining how it works\n",

For each method, I will explain about the method, what is does and how I tested it and provide the code of the method itself. Next, I show how to run the solution to the question. Each code fragment can be run in Jupyter notebooks, here.
