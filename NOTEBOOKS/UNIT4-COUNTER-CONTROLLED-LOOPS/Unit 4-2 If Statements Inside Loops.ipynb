A common example of this pattern of code is to need to do something different every 3 (say) numbers. This is equivalent to asking if a number is divisible by a given number (here divisible by 3). A simple way to test this is to check the remainder when you do a division. This is given by the **modulus** operator % \n",

    "When we have several methods doing a very similar thing, it is better to write one method that does the job for all. This is called generalisation and it is one of the things methods are very good for, that makes programs easier to read and to modify. In the above our methods divideby3 and divideby10 do very similar things.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a general method it can also be good to then create bespoke methods that use it with names that fit the purpose. For example, when we divide by 10 in the above program, it is to find the end of the row. It is therefore a good idea to create a method with a name that says that point is to find the end of the row. It can still call the general method to get the job done. This is an example of abstraction."
