This means <span style=\"color: red;\"> the dot notation is only used to refer to the fields **in the accessor methods** </span> - and that is the key point.\n",

It is a continuation of the idea of **localisation**. We want to keep the amount of code we need to read as small as possible to understand it. We also want to make sure to make a change that affects the whole program we only need to change a small part of the program. \n",

    "These methods are just normal methods. There is nothing special about them. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several styles of programming to do this, however. We will first look at a 'functional' style of doing it, where both methods return a value. Later we will see a more 'procedural' style. If you later do an OOP module then you will see a third 'object-oriented' way to do the same thing. "

    "The method setLeaderName takes a record value and a String value to store in its name field. What it does is take that record value and create a new record value with the new name in place of the old one. It does this by storing the record value passed in the local variable <span style=\"color: red;\">(the formal parameter)</span> called ldr. It then uses normal assignment of the passed value which has been stored in nm to the name field. Finally, it returns the new record value stored in the variable ldr.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The method call returns a new record value with the updated name. If we are going to use that value we need to store it somewhere. Actually we want to update the original leader variable, so we store the new record variable back there using assignment:\n",
