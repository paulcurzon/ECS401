    "## Abstract Data Types\n",
    "Abstract data types are basically just what the name says: types that are abstract. \n",
    "- **Types** are just collections of values that share the same properties \n",
    "   - eg an int value is a whole number that you can do simple arithmetic operations on like add, subtract etc\n",
    "- **Abstraction** is just where the details of something are hidden from view or ignored so that the essential properties are focussed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **abstract data type** or **ADT** is, therefore, one where the implementation details are hidden and instead the operations you can perform on values of the type (including creating them) are focussed on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that this provides a way to structure large programs, so that once the code for a set of primitive operations has been written for a new data type, it can then be used without the programming having to care how it was implemented. They just have to know what the operations provided do.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is a queue data structure. It might be implemented as an array but once implemented, we can forget that. All we need to know as a programmer using it is that we have instructions to add to the queue and remove from the queue and the property that data is removed in the order it was added. In fact, this basic idea is built into the basic types. You have been using integers without necessarily knowing that they are actually implemented in a particular way as a series of binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract data types can be implemented in several ways in Java. We will be looking at a simple \"functional\" way here based on functions. In a later unit, we will see a second procedural way. Ultimately though this idea is the foundation to object oriented programming, which is a third way. You will see this on a later module."

    "## Refresher\n",
    "We have seen in Unit 7.1 how to create accessor methods that allow us to get the values stored in the fields of a record and set new values. The simple version of this is to just create a method to get values from each field and a method to set new values  for each field. Other methods then just use these accessor methods to access the record rather than doing so directly. The methods provide an **interface** to the record - essentially hiding the fact that it is a record from the rest of the program. If an operation is not allowed (for example, perhaps the values of a field must never be changed once set), you just don't provide a method to do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen this already with the String type. The actual underlying way the characters of a String are stored is hidden by the interface. You are provided with a way to create values: just put double quotes around a series of characters, and you have created a String. Alternatively, you can use + to create a new string by concatenating copies of old ones together. You can also do a fixed set of operations on existing strings like getting a single character (using method charAt). You have no way to change the value of a single character in a String, however. You can create and manipulate strings without even thinking about how they are stored or represented. We want to get the same effect for all new types we create as being able to ignore the underlying implementation of a type makes code that uses it easier to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at a more sophisticated version of using methods to access records here, but first, we will look at the simple ways of doing things we have already seen on the example we will use.\n",

    "## A Timer\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are writing an adventure program and need a timer that ticks down as game time passes. Quests have to be completed before the time is up. We decide to create a new type of Timer (a record type) that stores the time left."

    "## The advantages of ADTs: forget the implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages about using a well designed ADT is that it makes the program more readable and easier to write so also easier to change. Once we have a clean interface we can forget completely about the underlying way it is implemented and just think of it as the thing it represents: it is a Timer and behaves like one! We just think about the primitive operations (eg createTime, convertTimerToString, timeIsUp and tick). We do not have to know or care how it is implemented as long as we understand what these methods that implement the primitive operations do.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to move on in 10 second jumps in some part of the program, rather than in single seconds at a time, we can just write a method to jump 10 seconds at a time just *using the primitive operation tick*.\n",

    "Abstract data types are the basis of a style of programming aiming to make writing large programs less error-prone by making them easier to read as they can be understood locally. Data structures are defined as new types with an interface provided by a set of methods defining their primitive operations. Once defined the rest of the program just refers to the primitive operations to create and manipulate values of the data structure. The programmer, therefore, can ignore precisely how the data structure is implemented. They just need to know what the operations provided by the ADT interface do, not how they do it. This means when writing the rest of the program, the programmer can think of the ADT as the thing it represents - a value of type Timer is just a Timer. The operations you can do are to create one, tick time, note the current time and check if the time is up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the implementation (the record type) is hidden by the set of primitive methods of the ADT means that implementation can be changed and nothing but the ADT methods need to be changed. If the new implementation still works, then the whole program will still work."
