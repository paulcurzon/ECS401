    "Something odd is happening. You would expect (given what we understand about assignment from the previous units) for the two examples to print the same results, but they don't. In the second example, changing a value in number1 has apparently changed number2 as well even though it is not mentioned. However, they are different variables - different storage spaces that are supposedly not connected. The example seems to suggest assignment has worked differently: as a result of the assignments the two variables appear to be now connected in a strange way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not jump to conclusions!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite what it looks like, it is NOT assignment that is working differently in the two situations. **It is the way different values are stored that causes the difference.** A variable declaration creates a storage space in memory ('a box') and the variable name is attached to that box. That is the case whatever the type of value stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple values like integers are stored directly in the box. So the result of \n",
    "```java\n",
    "num1 = 16;\n",
    "```\n",
    "is to put 16 in the storage space called num1.\n",

    "| :---: |\n",
    "| 16 |\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is stored differently, however. It is stored in two parts so involves two different storage spaces not just one. The first storage space is similar to the one for integers. It is the place in the computer memory the variable name actually refers to. However the array value itself is not stored there. Instead a **reference** to the value is stored there. A reference is just a **pointer**. It points to the second storage space reserved for the array which is where the actual value is stored. In reality, a reference is a **memory address**: just a big number identifying a specific place in memory. Memory addresses are a bit like the index of an array but giving the position in the whole of memory, rather than just a position in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, to help illustrate what is happening, we just use @1 as a shorthand for a particular memory address. We label the second, unnamed storage space by this memory address label. In reality it is just a memory address number.\n",
