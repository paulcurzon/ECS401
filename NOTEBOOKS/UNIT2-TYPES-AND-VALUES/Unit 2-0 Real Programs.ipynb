    "## Differences between code fragments and a real program\n",
    "The differences in a real program are all about structuring LARGE programs to make them easier to maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several big differences in the whole program to the fragments we see in these notebooks.\n",
    "1. EVERYTHING (all executable code and specifically procedure calls) are in a method!\n",
    "2. All methods are in a class\n",
    "3. We've used a different kind of comment\n",
    "4. You may need to load libraries of code\n",
    "\n",
    "### EVERYTHING (all procedure calls) are in a method!\n",
    "Perhaps the most important thing to notice now is that in the real Java program, their are 2 procedures. Can you find the other one and work out what it's name is?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first difference in a real program is that the call to our method (ie ```helloMessage();``` ) is itself INSIDE a method definition. Find the call. It is inside a method called **main**. There are no calls or other instructions outside of methods definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All programs have a method called main\n",
    "\n",
    "All Java programs have a method called main. When you run a program it finds main and executes those instructions. The method main will then call other methods to get things done. Here main has two instructions, one to call our method helloMessage, and one to exit (ie end) the program. The main method of every program should have such an exit statement. Aside from the way it ends (and some other small detail we will get to later), main is just a method like any other. It is just the method that is called automatically when you run a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a bit like there is an automatically added call to main like the ones we added to the end of our program fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All methods are in a class\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing is that all methods are inside a **class** (ie between a pair of enclosing curly brackets. For now you should think of the class as just grouping methods into a program with a name. \n",
    "```jav\n",
    "class hello  \n",
    "{\n",
    "    <method definitions go here>\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The curly brackets group all the methods into one class (ie program) and give it the name hello.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We've used a different kind of comment\n",
    "We've also used a new kind of comment. Anything between\n",
    "```java\n",
    "/**\n",
    "    This is a comment\n",
    "    that last over \n",
    "    several lines.\n",
    "**/\n",
    "```  \n",
    "is a comment just like anything after\n",
    "``` // This is a comment that lasts to the end of the line only```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second kind of comment you use ```/*``` to show where it starts and ```*/``` to show where it ends. Everything in between is just for a human reader.  Comments are clear explanations of the code for human readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first kind of comment is normally used for short notes to help a reader understand some simple aspect. This second kind is to write more detailed explanations. The extra ```*``` characters just help separate different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs are for people to read not just computers. **Good commenting** involves writing comments at the start of every method/procedure explaining what they do. This acts as a specification allowing a reader to quickly understand the situation a method should be used. They may also explain how particularly tricky parts of code work, that would not otherwise be immediately obvious to a reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You may need to load libraries of code\n",
    "Finally in a real program you will likely load in libraries. A library is just a collection of generally useful methods and other code written by someone else. By including a library you avoid rewriting methods someone else already wrote.  We do not have to worry about this yet as the above code does not need a library. However, to use the input scanners and methods, for example, you would need to import the scanner library so add to the very start of your code (just before the class\n",
